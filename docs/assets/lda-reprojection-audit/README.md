# LDA reprojection audit — 2026-09-28

**Trigger:** scheduled cron run of
`tools.hegre_dataset enrich --dataset .../hegre-faces/v1 --status approved --skip-stratum`,
expected to project "~1,500 missing per-image LDA files".

**Result: 0 LDA files projected. The job was already complete.**

The reprojection the job was written for ran in **late July 2026** (right after the
2026-07-23 basis refit): `scripts/reproject_lda.py` (committed 2026-09-22, `5e9b5f2`)
reprojects *approved* images only, writing refit-basis files with mtimes
**2026-07-25 / 2026-07-28** (mtime histogram, `mtime_hist.py`).

## Numbers (all reproducible from the scripts in this dir)

| quantity | value |
|---|---|
| approved images in review DB | 166,200 |
| approved images **missing** an LDA file | **23** |
| …of those, also missing AuraFace (⇒ **unprojectable**) | **23** |
| approved images with a usable LDA file | 166,177 |
| `.npy` files in `v1/lda/` (all statuses) | 295,468 |
| files written by this run | **0** |

Command output (`enrich.log`), exit 0:
```
Skipping Stratum enrichment (--skip-stratum).
Found 9 approved images with pose but missing z_g. Extracting...
z_g extraction complete in 0s. Extracted 0, skipped 9.
Found 23 approved images missing AuraFace data. Extracting...
Error: insightface not installed. Skipping AuraFace extraction.
All approved images already have AuraFace-LDA data.
Enrichment complete.

## Basis verification

* `v1/lda/BASIS_FINGERPRINT.json` stamps `120e1c5a1dc4f423`, convention
  *"refit basis, raw coords (norm ~153)"*.
* `hegre-dataset basis-fingerprint verify` on the current
  `experiments/geometry_pca/output/` artifacts → **`120e1c5a1dc4f423`** (match).
  So `project_to_lda` would have projected onto the same basis as the existing
  files. `experiments/` is a real directory, not a symlink (no
  `Path(__file__).resolve()` trap).
* Existing file norms: median **153.6**, p1 149.2, p99 157.9 — matches the stamped
  raw-coords convention.

## Finding — the `lda/` dir is mixed-basis at file level (no approved impact)

Full scan of all 295,468 files (`scan_all_lda.py`, `all_lda.log`):

* **2,220 files (0.751%)** have pre-refit norms (min 0.234, i.e. ≈ new-basis
  norm ÷ ~440), mtimes **2026-07-03 → 2026-07-06** — *before* the 2026-07-23 refit.
* Cross-referenced against the review DB (`xref_prerefit.py`, `xref.log`):
  **all 2,220 belong to tainted images** —
  2,219 `tainted:extraction_nonface` + 1 `tainted:contamination`.
  **Zero approved images carry a pre-refit LDA file.**
* Root cause: `reproject_lda.py` reprojects only `status='approved'`; images that
  were approved on 2026-07-03 and *later* reclassified as tainted kept their stale
  pre-refit files.

**Consequence:** the stamp's `scope: "all samples"` overstates uniformity — 0.75% of
files in the directory are on a different basis. Any consumer that reads the dir
*without* filtering on `images.status` would silently mix bases. Approved-only
consumers (corpus build, enrich) are unaffected. Suggested (not executed):
reproject or archive the 2,220 tainted files so the directory matches its stamp.

## Non-errors observed

* **9** approved images missing `z_g`: their `pose.npy` face keypoints
  (slice `23:91`) are **all zero** — DWPose found no face. Legitimate skip, not an
  error (`enrich` correctly reports "Extracted 0, skipped 9").
* **23** approved images missing AuraFace: these originally failed SCRFD face
  detection (`_face1/_face2`, `-board`, `-poster` crops). Cannot be projected —
  there is no embedding to project. Requires InsightFace (GPU) to retry;
  `insightface` is not installed in `.venv`, so `enrich` skipped them.

## Re-run — 2026-09-30 (scheduled cron, same command)

Identical outcome. `enrich` exit 0, **0 files written**
(`enrich-20260930.log`); independent `probe_scan.py` re-sweep over all 166,200
approved images (`probe_scan-20260930.log`):

| quantity | 2026-09-28 | 2026-09-30 |
|---|---|---|
| approved images | 166,200 | **166,200** |
| approved missing LDA | 23 | **23** (all also missing AuraFace ⇒ unprojectable) |
| approved missing z_g | 9 | **9** |
| approved missing pose.npy | — | **0** |
| LDA files written by the run | 0 | **0** |

Existing LDA norms sampled 152.6–154.8 (refit raw-coords convention), so the
directory is unchanged. No new approvals since 2026-09-28; the job remains
complete. The cron job's premise ("~1,500 missing per-image LDA files", new
refit basis) is **stale** — that reprojection ran 2026-07-25/28 — so every
future run of this job will sweep 166k NFS paths to report zero.
